# Generalised catch curve regression
This repository contains code to support Tonkin et al. (in prep.) Idiosyncratic combinations of river flow and temperature govern recruitment dynamics of an equilibrium fish species in five rivers over 20 years.

This work examines trends in native fish recruitment in five Victorian rivers. Fitted models were based on catch curve regressions, extended to use length data with unknown ages and to include several metrics of streamflow.

## Usage
The `code` directory contains multiple scripts to load data, fit models, and summarise fitted models. The primary scripts are numbered in order of use (from 00-05). Note that raw data are not provided here, so `00-prepare-data-objects.R` cannot be run. The outputs of this script will be uploaded as compiled data files in RDS format on acceptance.
